If a SecurityManager is installed and the above program is run,
it will likely throw a SecurityException when trying to access the file system to read input.txt and write output.txt.
This is because with a SecurityManager, the program needs to be granted specific permissions to access system resources like the file system. By default,
sandboxed code does not have permission to read or write files.

The output would look something like:

/home/user
Error java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.io.FilePermission" "input.txt" "read")

The user's home directory path would print successfully, but then an AccessControlException would occur when trying to construct the Scanner with input.txt.
The rest of the try block would not execute.

The catch block would catch the exception and print the error message. So the key point is that with a SecurityManager in place,
additional permissions need to be explicitly granted to allow file system access. Otherwise, a SecurityException will be thrown when trying to access protected system resources.
